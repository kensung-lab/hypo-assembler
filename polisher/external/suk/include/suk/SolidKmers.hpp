/** Defines the class SolidKmers.
 * It represents the solid (unique) kmers as a bit-vector.
 * DNA alphabet has four letters/bases:"ACGT". Therefore, there are `4^k` number of distinct kmers possible. 
 * DNA alphabet can be represented by 2 bits per base: `00`, `01`, `10`, `11`. Thus each kmer can be represented in `2k` bits. 
 * If we encode each base of a kmer into bits, it represents a unique number. Consequently, we have one-to-one correspondence between kmers and numbers of `2k` bits.
 * Thus, we can show the collection of kmers appearing in data as a bit-vector of length `2k`. 
 * Each index of the vector represents a kmer; if a kmer is prsent, we set the bit at the corresponding index; otherwise, reset.
